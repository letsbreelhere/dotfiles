# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. Trying to keep fanciness and dependencies to a minimum. Hopefully I remembered not to commit my passwords here.

Sorry about the commit messages. I tend to tweak things day-by-day and commit in big chunks so I don't lose them, so the commits themselves aren't coherently grouped at all.

# Usage

`./setup` in the cloned directory should symlink everything automagically.
